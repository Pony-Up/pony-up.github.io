                    Legal
                    Privacy Policy
                    Effective date: June 9, 2022
                    We know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and Pony Up takes your
                    privacy seriously. So that you may better understand how we use your data, we’ve provided our
                    privacy guidelines and procedures in the policy below (the “Privacy Policy”). Please read the
                    following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the Services in any manner,
                    you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you
                    hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.

                    Remember that your use of the Services is at all times subject to Pony Up’s Terms of Service (the
                    “Terms”), which incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference. Any capitalized terms used in this
                    Privacy Policy without definitions have the definitions given to them in the Terms.

                    What does this Privacy Policy cover?
                    Except as provided herein, this Privacy Policy covers only our data practices for information that
                    we gather from your access or your use of the Services. With the exception of the specific practices
                    noted in the Supplemental Privacy Notice to California Residents (found at the end of this Privacy
                    Policy), it does not apply to the practices of other companies or people that we don't own or
                    control.

                    Will Pony Up ever change this Privacy Policy?
                    We're constantly improving our Services and must also comply with constantly changing federal and
                    state laws, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will alert you if
                    there are any material changes by placing a notice on the myponyup.com site, by sending you an
                    email, via the Services and/or by some other means. Please note that if you've opted not to receive
                    legal notice emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal
                    notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and
                    understanding them. By using, or otherwise accessing, the Services after any changes to the Privacy
                    Policy have been posted, you are effectively agreeing to all of the changes.

                    What Information does Pony Up Collect?
                    We obtain information from you through the means discussed below when we provide the Services to you
                    and when you use the Services. Please note that we need certain types of information to provide the
                    Services to you. If you do not provide us with the required information, or if you ask us to delete
                    that information, you may no longer be able to access or use certain Services.

                    Information You Provide to Us:

                    We may collect information that you provide directly to us through the following methods:

                    When you use our Services, e.g., when you register for an account, request a service from a Pet Care
                    Provider, or communicate with a Pet Owner looking for services from a Pet Care Provider;
                    When you participate in surveys or fill out forms;
                    When you register for promotions;
                    When you request customer support and/or technical assistance; and
                    When you otherwise communicate with us or other users, including Pet Care Providers or Pet Owners,
                    through the Services.
                    The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include, but is not
                    limited to, the following:

                    Identifiers and Contact Information. We may collect identifiers and other contact information from
                    you, such as your name, email address, phone number, and address. With your consent, you may also
                    grant us access to your mobile device’s address book, through which we would collect and store on
                    our servers all of your contacts and their contact information. We use your contact information to
                    help you find friends and other contacts who are Pony Up users, and to facilitate you inviting
                    friends and other contacts to use Pony Up.
                    Information Regarding Pets. For example, we may collect information regarding your pet, such as
                    vaccinations and health history, age, and videos and photographs of your pet.
                    Financial Information. In your use of the Services, you may provide us or our service providers with
                    financial information such as financial account or credit card account information.
                    Location Information. We may collect general location information (e.g., inferred from your IP
                    address) or specific location information (i.e., geolocation with your consent). For example, we may
                    request geolocation information of Pet Care Providers when they are providing services for Pet
                    Owners. If you use a Pony Up Tag, we may also collect location information related to your pet.
                    Communications. We may collect communications you make through the Services, such as when you
                    communicate with us or other users. For example, Pet Owners may communicate with Pet Care Providers
                    through tools offered on the Services or you may communicate with our customer success team or other
                    members of the Pony Up team through email, text message or telephone. If you send text messages with
                    a Pet Owner or Pet Care Provider using the telephone number for that user available on the Services,
                    we may use a third-party service provider to track these text messages. We track these text messages
                    for fraud prevention, to enforce our Terms, and for quality and training purposes. As part of this
                    process, Pony Up and its service provider will receive in real time and store data about your text
                    message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content of the
                    text message.
                    Information From Affiliates, Business Partners, and Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties

                    We may collect information about you or others through our affiliates, business partners, or through
                    other non-affiliated third parties. For example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole
                    discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information about you from third parties. Examples of
                    this include information to verify your identity for fraud prevention, for safety protection
                    purposes, or information that enhances our ability to market products or services that may be of
                    interest to you. We may also work with business partners to integrate our services into their
                    services (and/or vice versa). Where you choose to use such integrated services, we may receive
                    information about you as part of that integration. We may combine information that we collect from
                    you through the Services with information that we obtain from such third parties and information
                    derived from other products or services we provide.

                    You may be able to access the Services through a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you
                    access the Services through your Facebook account, you may allow us to access certain information
                    within your Facebook account including, but not limited to, your name, profile picture, gender,
                    networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people
                    you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes."

                    Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies for handling your information.
                    For a description of how these sites may use and disclose your information, including any
                    information you allow the public to access on their platforms, please consult each site’s privacy
                    policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal
                    information it collects about you.

                    Information Collected Automatically

                    Device and Usage Information. Whenever you interact with our Services, we and our third-party
                    service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies such as Google Analytics, may
                    use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers
                    or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services. The information collected
                    includes, without limitation, your IP address, device identifier, “cookie” information, the type of
                    browser and/or device you use to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested.

                    Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies. We and our third-party service providers may use cookies,
                    clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior,
                    personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Services. These
                    technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Services to your needs, save your password in
                    password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics
                    about usage of our Services. We or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these
                    technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our
                    emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

                    We may also use local shared objects (also known as "Flash cookies") to assist in delivering special
                    content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not
                    managed through your web browser. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the
                    Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.

                    You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
                    your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
                    disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Services, because it may not
                    function properly. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management
                    tools available in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we continue to update our current
                    products and develop new technologies, we may also gather additional information through other
                    methods.

                    How Does Pony Up Use Your Information?
                    We use your information for business and commercial purposes, such as:

                    To provide you with the Services, including to register you for an account and process transactions
                    such as boarding or walking services;
                    To respond to your questions or inquiries, including to provide customer support and troubleshooting
                    assistance;
                    To communicate with you, including to send you emails about products and services that may interest
                    you;
                    To facilitate matching you with other users (Pet Owners or Pet Care Providers) based on your
                    requests for specific services;
                    To manage and remember your preferences and personalize the Services; To analyze and improve the
                    Services or any other products and services we provide;
                    To suggest products and services that may interest you;
                    To administer surveys, sweepstakes, promotions, or contests;
                    To verify your identity;
                    To comply with our legal obligations or as permitted by law;
                    To protect the safety and/or integrity of our users, employees, third parties, members of the
                    public, pets, and/or our Services;
                    To prevent fraud and enforce our legal terms; and
                    To administer and troubleshoot the Services.
                    We may combine information that we collect from you through the Services with information that we
                    obtain from affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties, and information derived from any other
                    products or services we provide.

                    We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Services. We may use
                    de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and
                    marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including without
                    limitation, advertisers, promotional partners, sponsors, event promoters, and use and disclose such
                    information with third parties at our discretion, including without limitation to auditors,
                    investors, creditors, and/or others.

                    Will Pony Up Share Any of the Information it Receives?
                    Affiliates and Business Partners. We may share your information with affiliates and business
                    partners. For example, businesses or third-party websites we've partnered or otherwise affiliated
                    with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services
                    (either alone or jointly with us). For example, business partners or affiliated businesses may
                    integrate our Services into their products, including mobile apps. When you use our Services through
                    one of these integrations, we may share your information with that affiliate or business partner. We
                    have no control over the policies and practices of these third-party affiliates or business
                    partners, so if you choose to participate in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated or
                    third-party website or business, please review all such business’s or website’s policies.

                    Consent/At Your Direction. We may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third parties to: (a)
                    facilitate matching you with a Pet Owner or Pet Care Provider; (b) when we have your permission; or
                    (c) as described in this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, or any other legal terms governing
                    your use of the Services.

                    Pet Owners. If you are a Pet Care Provider, we may share general information with Pet Owners about
                    the extent to which their Pet Care Providers providing pet care services (such as boarding) may have
                    remained with pets during a pet care session. We may also share with Pet Owners the precise
                    geolocation of their Pet Care Providers during or near the time of a walking session.

                    User Profiles and Submissions. Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and
                    any video or image content that you upload to the Services may be displayed publicly or to other
                    users. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any
                    information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on
                    discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.), becomes publicly available, and can be
                    collected and used by anyone. Your username and communications may also be displayed to other users
                    if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other
                    users can contact you through messages and comments. Again, we do not control the policies and
                    practices of any other third-party site or service with regard to your data.

                    Address Books. We may request authorization from you and other users to access and store contacts
                    from mobile device address books. We use this information to help users identify which of their
                    contacts they would like to invite to use our Services. We also use this information to alert users
                    if any of the contacts in their address books currently are or become registered users of Pony Up.

                    Service Providers. We work with other companies and individuals that may perform tasks on our behalf
                    that requires us to share your information with them in order for them to provide us with services,
                    such as to process payments.

                    Protection of Pony Up and Others. We may share or disclose certain information if we believe in good
                    faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety, or
                    property of Pony Up or third parties, including to defend or enforce our Privacy Policy, our Terms
                    of Service, or any other contractual arrangement; (ii) respond to your requests for customer
                    service; and/or (iii) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Pony Up, its agents and
                    affiliates, its employees, users and/or the public.

                    Legal Requirements. We may share or disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that
                    doing so is necessary or appropriate in order to comply with any law enforcement, legal, or
                    regulatory process. Examples of this may include responding to a warrant, subpoena or any other
                    applicable laws and regulations.

                    Business Transfers. We may share or disclose certain information, in connection with or during
                    negotiations of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of
                    our business to another company.

                    Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising
                    Analytics

                    We may use third-party web analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics.
                    These service providers use the sort of technology described in the “Information Collected
                    Automatically” section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the
                    third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be
                    disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who will then use that to evaluate
                    your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising,
                    as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for
                    analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.

                    Tailored Advertising

                    Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Services may also place
                    cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect
                    information about your use of the Services in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing
                    content based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing
                    content impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing
                    impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites. We may also allow other
                    third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to serve tailored
                    marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer,
                    mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does
                    this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on
                    your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated,
                    third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those
                    parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as
                    described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.
                    Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily
                    have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed,
                    non-human-readable form.

                    If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can
                    generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may
                    visit the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising
                    Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that
                    participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize
                    Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page. Please note that, to the
                    extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising
                    content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will be
                    present; it will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out
                    links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
                    availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when
                    you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or
                    change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is
                    available on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above links.

                    When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertising content.
                    Each operating system−iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft
                    devices−provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application
                    marketing content. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the
                    respective operating systems in order to opt out of tailored in-application advertising. For any
                    other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device
                    or contact the applicable platform operator.

                    Our Policy on Children’s Information
                    Our Services are not designed for minors under 18. Only persons 18 years of age or older may use the
                    Services. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal information, we
                    will close the account and delete the personal information to the extent required by the Children's
                    Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally
                    for purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

                    How Does Pony Up Protect Your Information?
                    Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account
                    via a third-party site or service, you may be offered additional or different sign-on protections
                    from that third-party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and
                    information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately
                    and limiting other’s access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have
                    finished accessing your account. We are not responsible for any unauthorized password activity
                    within your account.

                    We implement technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the information we
                    collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We cannot, however,
                    guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other
                    factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

                    Links to Third Party Sites and Services
                    The Services may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the
                    content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your
                    information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not
                    this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third parties.

                    What Choices Do I Have?
                    You have certain rights and choices with respect to your information, such as:

                    Profile & Account Information: Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases,
                    edit or delete certain information previously provided to us.
                    Marketing Emails: You can unsubscribe from marketing emails from us by clicking the unsubscribe link
                    located at the bottom of the email and following the directions in those emails.
                    Cookies & Analytics: You can opt out of certain cookie-related and analytics processing by following
                    the instructions found in this Privacy Policy.
                    Nevada Residents: Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “personally
                    identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell
                    such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information” includes first and
                    last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that
                    allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do not engage in such
                    activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from
                    us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by emailing
                    us at nevada.request@myponyup.com. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your
                    identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your evidence of your
                    request, which may be acted upon in the event our practices change.
                    California Residents: Please click here to view details on rights of California residents.
                    Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some
                    circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate
                    interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information
                    necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.

                    California Do-Not-Track Disclosure
                    Pony Up is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our
                    Services. However, Pony Up does not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track
                    signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do-Not-Track standards,
                    implementations and solutions.

                    Consent to Transfer
                    Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal information will be
                    processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer
                    the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By using the Services, you agree to
                    this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer and processing of all of your information to the
                    United States, which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in the European
                    Union or certain other countries.

                    What if I have questions about this policy?
                    If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please contact us at
                    legal@myponyup.com.

                    of businesses in the course of our provision or receipt of business-related services.

                    California law requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal information
                    that we have collected about California consumers, the categories of sources from which the
                    information was collected, the business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined by
                    applicable law) for which the information was collected, and the categories of parties with whom we
                    share personal information.

                    We or our service providers may collect the below categories of information for the following
                    business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined in applicable law):

                    new products or features);
                    Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third-party advertising and

                    offers from third-party partners; and

                    Rights

                    If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to
                    request that we:

                    Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the
                    last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial
                    purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties
                    with whom we shared personal information.
                    Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
                    Delete certain information we have about you.
                    You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you,
                    if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law)
                    for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under
                    applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Services to you. If
                    you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Services.

                    If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request here or submit an access
                    request to contact@myponyup.com or a deletion request to contact@myponyup.com. You
                    will be required to verify your identity before we can honor your request. You can also designate an
                    authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written
                    authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will
                    still need to verify your identity directly with us.



                    Notice of Financial Incentives
                    We may offer certain programs in which eligible consumers receive rewards or incentives if they opt
                    into sharing certain information with select business partners. You can opt into the rewards or
                    incentives by expressly directing us to share your information when presented with the option. Your
                    participation is completely voluntary, and you have a right to withdraw your consent. If you decide
                    you do not want to participate, you can refrain from opting into this type of data sharing.

                    The specific reward or incentive offered, if any, is made available to you when you are given an
                    option to share your information. The monetary value of the reward or incentive is a reasonable
                    approximation of the monetary value of the sharing of your information. We have arrived at this
