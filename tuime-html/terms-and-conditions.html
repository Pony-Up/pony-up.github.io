                <p class="desc">Terms of Service Updated: June 6, 2022 These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your
                  use of the Pony Up website, any Pony Up mobile application, application programming interfaces,
                  content, products and other services offered by Pony Up, as well as Pony Up services offered through
                  third parties integrating Pony Up functionality (collectively, the “Services”). Pony Up, Inc. (“Pony
                  Up”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) provides the Services. “You” refers to you as a user of any of the
                  Services. THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION IN SECTION 22 OF THESE TERMS CONTAINS A MUTUAL ARBITRATION
                  AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT REQUIRES YOU AND Pony Up TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH EACH OTHER
                  ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. PLEASE REVIEW THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                  SECTION OF THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU
                  HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE
                  CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION. The Services include a marketplace technology platform that
                  enables third-party pet owners (“Pet Owners”) and third-party pet care service providers (“Pet Care
                  Providers”) to connect with each other. Pony Up has no control over the conduct of Pet Care
                  Providers or any other users of the Services. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT Pony Up IS A TECHNOLOGY
                  SERVICES PROVIDER THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE PET CARE SERVICES. 1. Acceptance of these Terms By agreeing
                  to these Terms, and/or by using or accessing the Services (including without an account), you
                  expressly acknowledge that you understand and accept all of the terms (including the dispute
                  resolution and arbitration provisions below). BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE
                  TERMS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
                  THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES. 2. Changes to these Terms Pony Up may, in its
                  sole discretion, amend the Terms and modify or update the Services from time to time. If we change
                  these Terms, we will give you notice by posting the revised Terms on the Services. Please review
                  this page periodically to ensure you are up-to-date with any changes. Those changes will go into
                  effect on the revision date shown in the revised Terms. Your continued use of the Services will
                  constitute your acceptance of the amended Terms. 3. Additional Terms Our Privacy Policy, Community
                  Guidelines, and other Policies applicable to your use of the Services are incorporated by reference
                  into these Terms (the “Additional Terms”), as updated from time to time. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE
                  SERVICES, YOU ACCEPT THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS. We will make Additional Terms available for you to read
                  through the Services. If you do not agree to abide by the Additional Terms, you automatically opt
                  out of and are prohibited from using the Services. If you violate the provisions of the Additional
                  Terms, Pony Up may, in its sole discretion, suspend, discontinue, or change your account or any
                  aspect of your access to or use of the Services in whole or in part. By continuing to use the
                  Services, you agree to the Additional Terms and any future amendments and additions to the
                  Additional Terms as published from time to time through the Services. Please review the Additional
                  Terms periodically to ensure you are up-to-date with any changes. 4. Your Consent to Receive Calls,
                  Text Messages, Emails, and Other Communications You expressly consent to receive and accept
                  communications from Pony Up, our Affiliates (as defined below), and their respective
                  representatives, including via e-mail, telephone calls, text messages (including by an automatic
                  telephone dialing system or a prerecorded voice), push notifications, or other comparable means at
                  any of the e-mail addresses and/or telephone numbers provided by you or on your behalf to Pony Up.
                  You agree that the foregoing authorized communications may be initiated for any transactional,
                  customer service, advertising, marketing, promotional, debt collection, account administration, or
                  other purposes. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSENT TO RECEIVE PRERECORDED OR
                  AUTODIALED PROMOTIONAL, ADVERTISING, OR MARKETING (COLLECTIVELY, “MARKETING”) CALLS OR TEXT MESSAGES
                  AS A CONDITION OF PURCHASING ANY PROPERTY, GOODS, OR SERVICES. IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF MARKETING
                  CALLS, EMAILS, OR TEXT MESSAGES FROM US, YOU AGREE TO OPT OUT BY FOLLOWING ANY UNSUBSCRIBE
                  INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED TO YOU IN THOSE COMMUNICATIONS OR BY CONTACTING CUSTOMER SUCCESS AT (323)
                  205-7669 OR contact@myponyup.COM. If you receive a marketing call from Pony Up, you also may opt-out
                  of receiving future marketing calls by communicating a do-not-call request to our representative
                  before you hang up. You agree that Pony Up and our Affiliates and representatives will not be
                  responsible for honoring opt-out requests communicated through other channels. If you wish to
                  register an account with Pony Up without agreeing to receive autodialed or prerecorded marketing
                  calls or text messages from Pony Up and our Affiliates, contact a Customer Success representative
                  for assistance at (323) 205-7669 or contact@myponyup.com. Standard text messaging and data charges
                  charged by your wireless service carrier will apply to text messages we may send. You represent and
                  warrant that you are authorized to approve the receipt of calls and text messages at any telephone
                  number you provide to us in connection with your account or your use of our Services and to approve
                  any related carrier charges. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT IF YOU OPT OUT OF MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS, Pony
                  Up MAY STILL SEND YOU COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT OR ANY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN YOU, Pony Up,
                  AND/OR OTHER USERS OF THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING THE SERVICES YOU PROVIDE TO OR RECEIVE FROM OTHER
                  USERS OF THE PLATFORM. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OPTING OUT OF RECEIVING TEXT MESSAGES OR OTHER
                  COMMUNICATIONS MAY IMPACT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. 5. Eligibility You must be at least 18 years old
                  to use the Services. If you are under the age of majority in your state of residence or a minor,
                  your parent or legal guardian must agree to these Terms on your behalf and you may only access and
                  use the Services with permission from your parent or legal guardian. 6. Pony Up as a Marketplace
                  Technology Platform The Services include a marketplace technology platform that connects Pet Care
                  Providers with Pet Owners. We do not provide any pet care services and make no representations or
                  warranties about the quality of pet walking, boarding, sitting, transportation, or other services
                  provided by Pet Care Providers, or about your interactions and dealings with Pet Care Providers or
                  other users. Pony Up does not employ, recommend, or endorse Pet Owners or Pet Care Providers, and we
                  are not responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Pet Owners or Pet Care Providers,
                  whether online or offline. Pony Up does not procure insurance for Pet Owners (or their pets) or Pet
                  Care Providers, nor is Pony Up responsible for the property of Pet Owners or Pet Care Providers.
                  Pony Up provides Pet Care Providers with access to third-party vendors that perform background
                  checks and verifications. Pony Up itself does not conduct background checks and does not
                  independently verify information in the background checks. Pony Up is not responsible or liable in
                  any manner for the background checks. 7. Payment Terms for Pet Owners 7.1 General Payment Terms As a
                  Pet Owner, you understand that use of the Services may result in you owing fees to the Pet Care
                  Provider for the pet care services you receive from such Pet Care Provider. Pony Up will facilitate
                  your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the Pet Care Provider through third-party
                  payment processors, with whom you will be required to establish an account to access the Services.
                  Payment of such charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you
                  to the Pet Care Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law.
                  Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable regardless of your decision to terminate usage of
                  the Services, Pony Up’s decision to terminate your usage, any disruption of the Services, or any
                  other reason whatsoever, unless otherwise determined by Pony Up. All charges are due immediately and
                  Pony Up, or a third-party payment processor, will process your payment on the Pet Care Provider’s
                  behalf using the primary payment method designated by you in your Pony Up account. If your primary
                  payment method is determined to be expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree
                  that Pony Up may, as the Pet Care Provider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary
                  payment method in your account, if available. Pet Owners and Pet Care Providers transact with each
                  other on the Pony Up marketplace technology platform when they both agree to a “booking” that
                  specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of pet care
                  services via the booking mechanism provided on the Pony Up marketplace technology platform. You may
                  choose to transact with certain Pet Care Providers from time to time based on a variety of factors
                  in your discretion, such as your desired price range, a Pet Care Provider’s pet service price rate,
                  a Pet Care Provider’s profile, and a Pet Care Provider’s star ratings and reviews. Once you request
                  a pet care service, you agree to pay the Pet Care Provider the agreed-to price and honor the other
                  terms of such booking. You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Pet Care Provider at
                  any time prior to such Pet Care Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be subject to a
                  cancellation fee. The fees owed to Pet Care Providers are not inclusive of tip or gratuity for the
                  Pet Care Provider. While you are free to provide gratuity to any Pet Care Provider who provides you
                  with services obtained through the Services, you are under no obligation to do so. After you have
                  received services or goods obtained through the Services, you will have the opportunity to rate your
                  experience and leave additional feedback about your Pet Care Provider. In addition to the above
                  fees, you understand and acknowledge that you may incur ancillary charges in connection with your
                  receipt of pet care services from Pet Care Providers (“Charges”). Such Charges may include some
                  combination of the following: (1) cancellation fee, (2) service, booking, or platform usage fee, (3)
                  trust and safety fee, (4) surcharges, (5) convenience fee, and (6) other fees. A description of any
                  Charges will be available on the Services. You have absolute discretion to request or not request
                  services from a Pet Care Provider if the total applicable fee or charge is not acceptable to you.
                  From time to time, Pony Up may, in its sole discretion, make available certain promotions, offers,
                  credits, rewards, subscriptions, or referrals links or codes to Pet Owners (the “Promotions”). Such
                  Promotions will be provided to Pet Owners via the Services, by email, or otherwise made available
                  electronically by Pony Up. Such Promotions are only valid for redemption through the Services and
                  are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Each Promotion is a limited
                  time offer and is valid only for the time and purpose and under the terms and conditions specified
                  therein, which may include eligibility, time, and location requirements. Pony Up, at its sole
                  discretion, reserves the right to issue Promotions with different features, discounts, offers, or
                  deals to any users or groups of users determined solely by Pony Up. These Promotions, unless made to
                  you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your use of the Services or any Promotions offered to you.
                  Pony Up reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained
                  through the use of Promotions that were made in error or obtained through fraud or suspected illegal
                  behavior, or where the Pet Owner was found to be in violation of the terms of such Promotion, these
                  Terms, or the Additional Terms. Promotions may be modified, disabled, or withdrawn by Pony Up at any
                  time for any reason or no reason without liability to Pony Up. You acknowledge and agree that Pony
                  Up may limit or temporarily or permanently suspend your use of or access to the Services if: (1) you
                  have provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated, or incomplete information regarding a payment
                  method, (2) any amounts you owe for pet care services are overdue or in default, or (3) Pony Up
                  believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or
                  property of Pony Up, our users, any third-party payment processor or third parties, or to prevent
                  fraud or other illegal activity. 7.2 Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation Pony Up PREMIUM
                  PAID MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS WILL CONTINUE INDEFINITELY UNTIL CANCELLED BY YOU. AFTER YOUR INITIAL
                  SUBSCRIPTION COMMITMENT PERIOD, AND AGAIN AFTER ANY SUBSEQUENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR
                  SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD EQUIVALENT TO THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM
                  YOU ORIGINALLY SELECTED AND AT THE SUBSCRIPTION RATE AND FREQUENCY DISCLOSED TO YOU WHEN YOU
                  ORIGINALLY SUBSCRIBED, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED AT THE TIME YOU SUBSCRIBED. You may cancel your
                  paid membership subscription at any time by following the instructions on your account settings page
                  or by contacting Customer Success at (323) 205-7669 or contact@myponyup.com. If you cancel your
                  subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your
                  then-current subscription term. Your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term
                  expires, but your payment method will be charged, and you will be required to pay any cancellation
                  or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up
                  for the subscription plan. 7.3 Payment Authorization Upon addition of a new payment method or each
                  pet care service request, Pony Up may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify
                  the payment method, ensure the pet care service charges will be covered, and protect against
                  unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge; however, it may reduce your available
                  credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of the
                  authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of
                  NSF charges by the bank issuing your credit, debit, or prepaid card. Pony Up cannot be held
                  responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing
                  bank. Pony Up reserves the right to request additional information from you if we have reason to
                  believe, in our sole discretion, that a payment method may be fraudulent. 8. Acceptable Use of the
                  Services You are responsible for your use of the Services, and for any use of the Services made
                  using your account. Our goal is to create a positive, useful, and safe user experience. To promote
                  this goal, we prohibit certain kinds of conduct that may be harmful to other users, third parties,
                  or to us. When you use the Services, you may not: violate any law or regulation or use the Services
                  for any unintended or illegal purposes; violate, infringe, or misappropriate other people’s

                  otherwise objectionable; send unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or commercial communications,
                  such as spam; engage in spidering or harvesting, or participate in the use of software, including

                  computer instructions or technological means whose purpose is to disrupt, damage, or interfere with
                  the use of computers or related systems; stalk, harass, or harm another individual; impersonate any
                  person or entity, maintain more than one account (or, if Pony Up suspends or terminates your
                  account, create further accounts), or perform any other fraudulent activity, such as phishing,
                  marketplace collusion, promotional abuse, and payment fraud; use any means to scrape or crawl any
                  Web pages contained in the Services; use the Services to identify Pet Care Providers to complete
                  off-line transactions that circumvent your payment obligations for the Services; use the Services
                  for purposes of competing with Pony Up; authorize other users to use your user status or transfer
                  your account to any other person or entity; attempt to circumvent any technological measure
                  implemented by us, any of our providers, or any other third party (including another user) to
                  protect the Services; interfere with Pony Up’s provision of, or any other user’s use of, the
                  Services; attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any of the software or

                  the Services; post reviews about Pet Care Providers that are not based on your personal experience,
                  that are intentionally inaccurate, or that violate these Terms or Additional Terms; use the Services
                  to arrange for the care of exotic, non-domesticated, or inherently dangerous pets, pets with a
                  history of attacks on animals or people, or any other pets not specifically contemplated by the
                  Services; or advocate, encourage, or assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing. 9. User
                  Content The Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send, or receive data, information, and
                  content (“User Content”). You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in
                  that User Content. In other words, you own your personal data. When you upload, submit, store, send,
                  or receive User Content to or through the Services, you give us permission to reproduce and use your
                  User Content as follows: you grant to us and those we work with a license to use, host, store,
                  reproduce, modify, create derivative works (including, but not limited to, translations,
                  adaptations, or other changes we make so that User Content works better with the Services), publicly
                  perform, publicly display, and distribute your User Content in order to operate, promote, market,
                  and improve our Services. Our license to your User Content is non-exclusive, meaning you may use the
                  User Content for your own purposes or let others use your User Content for their purposes. This
                  license is irrevocable, sublicensable, fully-paid, and royalty free, meaning we do not owe you
                  anything else in connection with our use of your User Content. We may exercise our rights under this
                  license anywhere in the world. Lastly, this license is perpetual, meaning that our rights under this
                  license continue even after you stop using the Services. In general, however, we will only need to
                  use your User Content for as long as you choose to store it with us using the Services. You promise
                  that: you own all rights to your User Content or, alternatively, that you have the right to give us
                  the rights described above (including having the necessary consents and releases from any
                  individuals who appear or whose pets appear in your User Content); and your User Content does not
                  infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights
                  of any third party. We may refuse to accept or transmit User Content for any reason. We reserve the
                  right to use, share, and display your User Content (including Pet Owners’ reviews of Pet Care
                  Providers) or Pet Care Providers’ reviews of Pet Owners or their pet(s) in any manner in connection
                  with our business without attribution to you or your approval. You acknowledge and agree that we are
                  distributors (without any obligation to verify) and not publishers of your User Content or Pet Care
                  Providers’ reviews, and we reserve the right to monitor, screen, edit, or remove your User Content
                  or Pet Care Providers’ reviews in the event that such content include obscenities or other
                  objectionable content, include an individual’s name or other personal information, or violate any
                  privacy laws, other applicable laws, or Company’s content policies. Our failure to enforce our
                  rights under these Terms in one instance does not create a waiver of our right to enforce them in
                  another instance. We are not obligated to provide you with copies of your User Content, nor will we
                  have any liability to you for any deletion, disclosure, loss, or modification to your User Content.
                  If you include your name, image, likeness or voice in any of your User Content, you grant us
                  permission to use your name, image, voice, and likeness, and hereby release us from any liability
                  arising from such use, including, without limitation, claims for invasion of privacy, infringement
                  of your right of publicity, and defamation (including libel and slander). Pony Up offers an in-app
                  chat feature to better connect Pet Owners with Pet Care Providers. Data, information, and content
                  sent through the chat feature is User Content that is subject to these Terms. We are able to access
                  this User Content and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor, screen, edit, or remove
                  your User Content. Users should be mindful when communicating information to third parties, and we
                  recommend that you refrain from disclosing or sending sensitive information through the chat
                  feature, such as personal financial information, log-in account information, passwords, and/or
                  personal contact information (including phone numbers). The Services may provide the ability to
                  leave public and/or private reviews of users or their pets. You acknowledge that even private
                  reviews may be shared with third parties in accordance with applicable law and our Privacy Policy
                  and that Pony Up has no obligation to preserve or indefinitely store any reviews. If you are a Pet
                  Care Provider, we have no obligation to provide you with the content of any reviews about you
                  submitted by other users of the Services, whether before or after termination of your account for
                  the Services. We will have no liability to you for any deletion, disclosure, loss, or modification
                  of these reviews. We reserve the right to screen, edit, or remove these reviews from the Services at
                  any time. 10. Consent to Pet Care Provider Photo and Video Activities As a Pet Owner, you understand
                  and agree that certain Pet Care Providers may take pictures or videos or otherwise create recorded
                  media of you or your pet during the course of providing services to you. You also understand and
                  agree that during the course of a service you or your pet may participate in recorded media. You
                  further understand and agree that Pet Care Providers may post, upload, share, store, or otherwise
                  provide any such pictures, videos, or other forms of recorded media to Pony Up through the Services
                  or to their own social media, the Internet, or otherwise. You understand and agree that such
                  recorded media may be used not only to provide information to you as part of the Services, but also
                  to assist Pony Up in quality control, safety, and promotional and marketing activities. You agree
                  that you have no right, title, or other ownership interest to or in such pictures, videos, or other
                  forms of recorded media, and that the use of such media, including the posting or display of such
                  media, is within Pony Up’s and Pet Care Providers’ sole discretion. Pony Up hereby grants you a
                  limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to copy and use pictures, videos, and other forms of
                  recorded media of your pet that are made available by Pony Up through the Pony Up Services, solely
                  for non-commercial purposes (e.g., posting a photo on your social media accounts). 11. Pet Owner
                  Obligations As a Pet Owner, you hereby represent, covenant, and warrant to Pony Up and each Pet Care
                  Provider who provides you with pet care services that: (1) the pet(s) that you request pet care
                  services for are your own; (2) your pets are free from fleas, ticks, and other pests; (3) you have
                  divulged any material information about your pets, including pre-existing medical conditions and
                  other behavioral issues that may be relevant to or impact a Pet Care Provider’s ability to provide
                  the Services; (4) you will have your pets fully vaccinated and up-to-date on all forms of
                  preventative medicine prior to receiving services from a Pet Care Provider; (5) you will comply with
                  all laws and ordinances applicable to your activities conducted through the Services, including
                  ensuring your pet is licensed as required by local law; and (6) the pet(s) for which you are seeking
                  services are not dangerous or otherwise likely to injure others. If you elect to use the Services,
                  you agree to provide accurate information about yourself and your pet and keep this information
                  up-to-date, including any material information or medical data of your pet. You acknowledge and
                  agree that if you allow another person to access your account or if you request a pet care service
                  for a pet that is not your own, in each case in violation of these Terms, you and such other person
                  will be jointly and severally liable for all acts and omissions in connection with engaging the
                  Services, including all costs incurred or associated with such engagement. You are fully responsible
                  for the actions of your pet(s). You understand, acknowledge and agree that, as between you and Pony
                  Up, you shall be liable for any and all claims, costs, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, and
                  expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs) of any kind or
                  nature, arising from or relating to, the behavior of your pet(s), including without limitation,
                  claims by third parties (including Pet Care Providers) for damage, loss, or injuries resulting from
                  bites or attacks on such third parties by your pet(s). Incidents, injury, damage, or loss caused by
                  your pet may be governed by applicable state liability laws. Pony Up will cooperate with appropriate
                  law enforcement authorities to provide requested information regarding the situation. If you elect
                  to use a Pet Care Provider through the Services, you shall carry applicable liability insurance
                  sufficient for the pet care services you request, the risks associated with such services, and as
                  mandated by law. Be sure to review your applicable policy(ies) and address any questions regarding
                  appropriate liability coverage with your insurance carrier and/or legal representatives prior to
                  utilizing a Pet Care Provider through the Services. You may purchase or request a lockbox to store a
                  key for entrance to your home or apartment for use in connection with the Services. You understand,
                  acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss, claims, or damages you may suffer as a
                  result of your use of the lockbox, including situations where the lockbox may be illegally accessed
                  by a third party. You understand and agree that any Pet Care Provider from whom you may seek or
                  obtain pet care services via the Services is an independent contractor, and not a partner, joint
                  venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, worker, or employee of Pony Up. Pet Care Providers
                  have no ability or authority to represent Pony Up or otherwise make statements or commitments on
                  Pony Up’s behalf. Pet Care Providers have the sole and absolute discretion to reject or refuse any
                  pet care services that you may request, including if they violate any law or regulation, are
                  dangerous or unsafe, or otherwise violate these Terms or the Additional Terms. If you, in your sole
                  discretion, choose to provide equipment to Pet Care Providers, Pet Care Providers have the right to
                  refuse a pet care service that involves a retractable leash, which can be dangerous for pets and Pet
                  Care Providers alike, and may cause a safety hazard. You acknowledge and agree that you will assume
                  all liability in connection with providing a retractable leash. In addition, we encourage Pet Owners
                  to request only on-leash services. Please note that for safety reasons, puppies, kittens, or other
                  pets that are six (6) months or younger may be restricted from certain types of services offered via
                  the Pony Up platform or be subject to limited service offerings tailored specifically to young pets.
                  Pet Owners who arrange for pet care services and fail to retrieve their pet within three (3) days
                  after the service period (or an earlier period required under applicable animal abandonment or
                  cruelty laws) agree that Pony Up (or the Pet Care Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole
                  discretion, place the pet in foster care and/or notify animal control authorities. Pet Owner agrees
                  to reimburse Pony Up and/or the Pet Care Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such
                  actions. Furthermore, Pony Up expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet
                  Owner’s pet from a Pet Care Provider’s care should Pony Up deem it necessary for the safety of a
                  pet, the Pet Care Provider, or any third parties. Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Pet
                  Care Provider, Pony Up will use reasonable efforts during its normal business hours to contact the
                  Pet Owner and/or the Pet Owner’s emergency or trusted contact (if provided) to arrange alternative
                  care. Should Pony Up not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the emergency contact, Pony Up will use
                  its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Pet Owner is able to retrieve
                  his/her pet. If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s
                  veterinary records to Pony Up in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet. In
                  addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Pony Up in
                  connection with such transfer. If your Pet Care Provider or Pony Up reaches you with a request to
                  authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, you waive, release, and promise never to assert
                  any claims or causes of action arising from failure to seek such care, whether or not known at the
                  time of such refusal, against Pony Up or its predecessors, successors, past or present subsidiaries,
                  stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, attorneys, agents, assigns, or the
                  applicable Pet Care Provider with respect to any matter, including (without limitation) any claims
                  of negligence, emotional distress, fraud, breach of contract, or breach of the covenant of good
                  faith and fair dealing. You expressly waive and release any and all rights and benefits under
                  Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (or any analogous law of any other state), which reads as
                  follows: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
                  exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must
                  have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” In the unlikely case that your pet
                  needs immediate medical attention or veterinary care, you hereby authorize your Pet Care Provider
                  and Pony Up to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be
                  reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation. Pet Owners are solely responsible for
                  the costs of any such medical treatment for your pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby
                  authorize Pony Up to charge any of your payment methods for such costs. As a Pet Owner, you
                  acknowledge that Pony Up is in the business of connecting Pet Owners and Pet Care Providers, and
                  that said business is how Pony Up earns its income. As a result, Pet Owner agrees that if Pet Owner
                  solicits a Pet Care Provider to provide off-platform pet care services to Pet Owner whom Pet Owner
                  first met and/or learned about through the Pony Up platform, Pony Up is entitled to charge both the
                  Pet Owner and the Pet Care Provider a referral fee. This referral fee will be charged once per
                  specific Pet Owner/Pet Care Provider services relationship utilized outside of the process provided
                  for within the Pony Up platform. Pet Owner’s referral fee will be $1,000. Pet Owner will first be
                  notified in writing of Pet Owner’s obligation to pay the referral fee. Thereafter, Pet Owner hereby
                  authorizes Pony Up to charge any of your payment methods for the referral fee. 12. Ownership Other

                  acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and Pony Up only, and not with any Provider,
                  and that a Provider is not responsible for the Services; The Application is licensed to you on a
                  limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection

                  conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify the Provider of
                  such failure; upon notification, the Provider’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to
                  you the purchase price, if any, of the Application; You acknowledge and agree that Pony Up, and not
                  the Provider, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation
                  to the Application and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses
                  attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be Pony Up’s and not the Provider’s
                  responsibility; You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the
                  Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party's intellectual

                  that the Provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon
                  your acceptance of these Terms, the Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have
                  accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof; and In
                  the event you use the Application to provide you with real-time route guidance, YOUR USE OF THIS

                  Owner) and Pet Owners (when the Terms are agreed to between Pony Up and a Pet Care Provider) are
                  each a third-party beneficiary of these Terms, and that upon acceptance of these Terms, the Pet Care

                  using the Health Related Services, including but not limited to, “Ask a vet” and live digital
                  consultations, you expressly acknowledge that the Health Related Service is NOT a substitute for
                  veterinary care (whether emergency or otherwise), and you further acknowledge that we, the
                  veterinarians, and the Pet Care Providers cannot provide advice or consultation over the internet
                  regarding any specific medical condition (whether of an emergency nature, or otherwise) without a
                  thorough and proper physical evaluation of the pet. In addition, the quality of the responses
                  provided by the veterinarians and Pet Care Providers will be influenced directly by the quality of
                  the question asked (and the completeness and accuracy of the information conveyed by the person
                  asking the question), of which we, the veterinarians, and the Pet Care Providers have no control. If
                  your pet is sick, injured, or otherwise in need of medical attention, you agree to contact your
                  regular veterinarian or local emergency provider of veterinary services immediately, as neither Pony
                  Up nor the Health Related Services is the appropriate venue to deal with such situations. You also
                  expressly acknowledge and agree that in the case where one of the Pet Care Providers who is a
                  licensed veterinarian answers your question(s), a veterinarian-client patient relationship is NOT
                  and will NOT be established, and that the Health Related Services will NOT be able to diagnose,
                  treat, or prescribe any medication for your pet. You further acknowledge that the laws, regulations,
                  other governing authorities, standards, practices, and procedures that apply to your particular
                  question may differ depending upon your location or upon the information that typically would be
                  discovered through in-person (or in-pet) evaluations or visits. By using the Health Related
                  Services, you understand that any licensed veterinarian that answers your question(s) is NOT your
                  pet’s veterinarian, and that the information they provide to you is NOT a substitute for in-person
                  veterinary diagnosis and/or treatment. Please be advised that nothing transmitted to or via the
                  Health Related Services constitutes the establishment of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship
                  between you (or your pet) and any professional. We highly recommend that you always seek the advice
                  of your veterinarian or other qualified provider with any questions that you may have regarding your
                  pet’s medical condition, and that you do not disregard their advice (or delay seeking their advice)
                  because of something that you have read or otherwise been provided through the Health Related
                  Services. 20.3 Disclaimer of Insurance Entity Status Pony Up and Pony Up Wellness are not licensed

                  Indemnification You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pony Up and its Affiliates from and against
                  any and all claims, costs, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, and expenses (including, without
                  limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs) of any kind or nature, arising from or
                  relating to, any (i) actual or alleged breach of these Terms or the Additional Terms by you or
                  anyone using your account, including claims arising from a breach of any of the Pet Owner
                  Obligations set forth in these Terms or Additional Terms; (ii) transactions, interactions or
                  disputes with other users of the Services, whether online or offline; (iii) your misstatements,
                  omissions, misrepresentations, or violation of applicable law; (iv) any of Your Content; (v) any
                  text messages or other communications that you initiate to other Users or to third parties through
                  our Services; and (vi) the actions of your pet(s), including any property damage or personal injury
                  to third parties caused by your pet or pets under your care. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU WILL
                  COOPERATE WITH US IN THE DEFENSE AND INVESTIGATION OF SUCH CLAIMS. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ASSUME
                  THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS SECTION, AND
                  YOU WILL NOT SETTLE ANY SUCH CLAIM OR MATTER WITHOUT OUR PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. 22. Arbitration
                  Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights For purposes of this Section 22 (“Arbitration Agreement”),
                  references to “Pony Up” include our Affiliates. a. Applicability. You and Pony Up agree that any
                  dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Services, these Terms, the
                  Additional Terms, your relationship with Pony Up, or your receipt of any communications from Pony Up
                  will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except that
                  you may assert claims in small claims court to the extent your claims qualify, remain in such court,
                  and advance solely on an individual basis. “Disputes” or “claims” under this provision shall
                  include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim, or controversy, whether based on past, present,
                  or future events, arising out of or relating to: the Terms, the Additional Terms and prior versions
                  thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the
                  Services, any other goods, services, or content made available through the Services, your
                  relationship with Pony Up, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation, or termination of your
                  account with Pony Up, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any
                  promotions or offers made by Pony Up, any communications you receive from Pony Up, any claims for
                  fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any express or implied contract or covenant, claims
                  arising under federal or state consumer protection laws, claims arising under antitrust laws, claims
                  arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act, and claims
                  arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities
                  Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other
                  federal and state statutory and common law claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
                  if you are an employee of Pony Up, this Arbitration Agreement will not apply to any claims or
                  disputes arising out of your employment relationship with Pony Up and any such claims and disputes
                  may be governed by separate agreements. b. Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act
                  governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration
                  proceeding, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via certified mail, return
                  receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand
                  for arbitration must include (1) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration, (2) a
                  statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim, and (3) a description of the remedy sought.
                  Any demand for arbitration by you must be delivered to General Counsel, Pony Up Inc., 8 The Green,
                  Suite B, Dover, DE 19901, and contact@myponyup.com. The arbitration will be conducted by the
                  American Arbitration Association (“ AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider,
                  and conducted under AAA’s most current version of the Commercial Arbitration Rules and procedures
                  available at http://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules_Web.pdf. AAA’s rules are also
                  available by calling AAA at 800-778-7879. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will
                  select a reasonably equivalent alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot
                  afford to pay filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees necessary for the arbitration and
                  you cannot obtain a waiver for such fees, Pony Up will pay them for you. In addition, Pony Up will
                  reimburse all such filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for proceedings involving
                  claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Pony Up
                  will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims
                  are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
                  submissions, in person, or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered
                  by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. c. Authority of Arbitrator.
                  The arbitrator -- not a court -- shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and
                  enforceability of these Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement), (ii) resolve any dispute
                  related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms (including
                  this Arbitration Agreement), including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this
                  Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, and (iii) resolve any disputes or controversies regarding
                  or arising out of the applicability of these Terms, the Additional Terms, the Pet Care Provider
                  Platform Use Agreement, and/or any other concurrent agreement, to any particular claim or dispute,
                  consistent with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rule R-7 (or similar rule if not arbitrated by the
                  AAA). The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Pony Up. The
                  arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
                  arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy
                  or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these
                  Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
                  statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                  including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
                  relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
                  is final and binding upon you and Pony Up. d. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Pony Up HEREBY WAIVE ANY
                  CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
                  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to
                  very limited review. e. Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
                  WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON
                  A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS; ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF
                  MORE THAN ONE PARTY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER PARTY. If a
                  decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s
                  limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and
                  brought into the federal or state court located in Santa Clara County, California for adjudication
                  before a judge, not a jury. All other claims shall be arbitrated. f. 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You
                  have the right to opt out of the provisions of these Terms that mandate arbitration by e-mailing a
                  written notice of your decision to opt out to: contact@myponyup.com, within 30 days after first
                  becoming subject to a version of these Terms containing an arbitration provision. Your notice must
                  include your name and address, your Pony Up username (if any), the email address you used to set up
                  your Pony Up account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of
                  this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of arbitration, all other parts of this Agreement will
                  continue to apply to you. With the sole exception of the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement if
                  you are a Pet Care Provider, opting out of arbitration has no effect on any other arbitration
                  agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with Pony Up. If you are a Pet
                  Care Provider, a timely opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in these Terms will also apply to the
                  Mutual Arbitration Provision of the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement, provided that the opt
                  out would be timely under the terms of the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement as well. g.
                  Survival of Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
                  relationship with Pony Up. h. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the
                  contrary, we agree that if Pony Up makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement,
                  you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by emailing
                  Pony Up a notice of your rejection to contact@myponyup.com. Your rejection of any such changes shall
                  not affect the enforceability of any prior version of this Arbitration Agreement, or of any other
                  agreement to arbitrate, that you previously entered into with Pony Up. 23. Other Provisions Under no
                  circumstances will Pony Up be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in
                  part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control. These Terms will be
                  governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, consistent with
                  the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions. In
                  the event the Arbitration Agreement above is found not to apply to you or a particular claim or
                  dispute, you agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or
                  Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County,
                  California. You and Pony Up consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the
                  purposes of any such action. YOU AND Pony Up HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
                  APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN
                  ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES, THESE TERMS, THE ADDITIONAL TERMS, YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH Pony Up, OR YOUR
                  RECEIPT OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS WITH Pony Up. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful
                  or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect
                  the enforceability of any other provisions. The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of
                  these Terms will not be deemed a waiver and will not prevent us from enforcing such right or
                  provision in the future. We may freely assign our rights and obligations under these Terms,
                  including in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or equity, or by
                  operation of law. You may not assign any rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior
                  written consent of Pony Up and any purported assignment in violation of this provision shall be null
                  and void.
